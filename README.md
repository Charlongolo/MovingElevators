### FAQ
My elevator just went through a block, is this normal?
Yes, the platform will ignore blocks not at floor level. This is for performance reasons, as checking hundreds of blocks every tick is not a good idea
Is there a limit on the distance between floors?
No, there is no limit
Does the Elevator Controller consume energy?
No, the Elevator Controller does not consume energy
